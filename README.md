## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose and back ground

The purpose of this project was to rewrite code in different ways to see the increase of speed by using arrays.

## Analysis and Challenges

The challenge was to use the knowlege of writing to an array and pulling data from it.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

the main challenge for me was to figure out the purpose of this challenge.
once the purpose was clearly defined the reserch and applications were acheiveable.
i did notice an issue of writing the wrong date would produce an error so, i looked into writing an exit if a user input did not match a year of the sheets available.
 
## Results

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general?
advantages of refactoring the code was the necessary code was lined up for use.
disadvantage was trying to remove remove unecessary data and making sure all the variables were set up correctly
 
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script?
advantages of the refactored code was the process went quicker. the changing of sheets every loop was probably the main delay.
in a case where a lot more data was used, the disadvantage of the original code would be noticed more.
